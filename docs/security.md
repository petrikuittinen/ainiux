# Security

- API keys are read from environment variables, key files, stdin, or explicit headers.
- `-k`/`--key` is supported for testing but warns because command-line arguments may be visible to other local users.
- Authorization-like headers and configured key values are redacted from transport errors.
- LM Studio authentication is optional by default.
- Local web mode and agent mode are not implemented yet.


## Chat Files

`--save-chat PATH` writes the transcript, provider name, base URL, model, settings, messages, usage, and compaction metadata. API keys and authorization headers are not saved. New chat files are written through a temporary file, fsynced where supported, renamed over the target, and created with mode `0600`.


## URL Fetching

The first v0.5 URL-fetching slice is explicit: `--fetch-url URL` fetches an HTML page and prints converted text or Markdown. It does not silently insert fetched content into a prompt.

Defaults:

- response body cap: 1 MiB unless `--max-fetch-bytes N` is set
- connect timeout: existing `--connect-timeout` default
- total timeout for fetch mode: 30 seconds unless `--timeout N` is set
- redirects: not followed in this slice
- request headers: sends browser-style `User-Agent`, `Accept`, `Accept-Language`, and `Upgrade-Insecure-Requests` headers
- content type: accepts empty content type, `text/html`, and `application/xhtml+xml`
- private/loopback/link-local/multicast/common metadata literal hosts are refused unless `--allow-private-url-fetch` is set

Current limitation: hostname checks are string/IP-literal based. DNS resolution followed by private-address verification is still required before treating arbitrary hostnames as fully protected against local-network probing.
