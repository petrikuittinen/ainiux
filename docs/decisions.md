# Decisions

## C++17 and Makefile

The initial implementation uses C++17 and a plain Makefile to keep the binary portable across POSIX-like systems.

## HTTP Transport

`src/http/` owns HTTP transport and uses libcurl through RAII wrappers for the easy handle and header list. The Makefile discovers build flags with `pkg-config libcurl`, falling back to `curl-config`. Streaming response bodies are delivered through libcurl write callbacks so provider code can parse SSE incrementally without spawning the `curl` executable.

## JSON Facade

`src/json/` is a small internal JSON facade used for request escaping and provider response parsing. The project should replace or expand it with a reviewed JSON library when dependency installation is available.


## JSON Chat Persistence

v0.2 stores explicit chat files via `--save-chat PATH` and `--load-chat PATH` before adding automatic XDG chat IDs. This keeps the early REPL scriptable and reviewable while still using the target schema fields: `schema_version`, timestamps, provider, base URL, model, settings, messages, attachments, usage, and compaction events. Saves use a temporary file, fsync, rename, and restrictive file permissions.
